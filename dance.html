      our cultural tour to the state is incomplete without experiencing Odisha s
      famous dance forms Odissi, Chhau, Gotipua, Danda Nata, Sambapuri, Dalkhai,
      Chaitighoda, and Medha Nacha. Odissi is an Indian classical dance and
      archeological evidence indicates that it is the oldest surviving dance
      form in the country.

      odissi, one of the principal classical dance styles of India; others
      include bharata natyam, kuchipudi, kathak, kathakali, and manipuri. It is
      indigenous to Orissa, eastern India, and follows the principles of the
      Natya-shastra.

    <p>
      Odissi dance pays great importance to Lord Jagannath who is considered to
      be the god of the universe and is worshipped by the people of Orissa.
